## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to track modifications, revert to previous stages, and work collaboratively with others without overwriting each other's changes.

1. Repository: This is where all the files and their versions are stored. It serves as the central place for collaboration.

3. Branching and Merging: Branches allow you to diverge from the main line of development and work on features or fixes in isolation. Merging combines changes from different branches.

4. Conflict Resolution: When two or more people make changes to the same part of a file, a conflict occurs. Version control systems help in resolving these conflicts.

Now, why is GitHub popular for managing versions of code?

1. Collaboration: GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers by providing features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.

2. Visibility: It allows developers to showcase their work, making it easy for others to find, use, and contribute to their projects.

3. Community: GitHub has a vast community of developers, making it a hub for open source projects and a platform for sharing knowledge and code.

4. Integration: It integrates seamlessly with various tools and services, enhancing the development workflow.

How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

1. Track Changes: Version control systems keep a record of every change made to the codebase, making it easier to identify when and why a particular change was made.

2. Revert Changes: If a new feature introduces bugs or issues, version control allows you to easily revert to a previous, stable version of the code.

3. Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously without interfering with each other's work, ensuring that changes are integrated smoothly.
4. Backup and Recovery**: Version control acts as a background mechanism, reducing the risk of losing work due to accidental deletions or errors.
